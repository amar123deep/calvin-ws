The 'edge' folder contains actors and a test application using them.
Copy the folder to the 'calvin-base/calvin/actorstore/systemactors' directory.
do 'git add' and 'git commit' to include these actors before you do ansible calvin installation setup.
Now you are ready to use these actors and define applications using these actors.
